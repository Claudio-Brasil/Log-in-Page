# Log-in-Page

> Status: Developing ⚠️

### This is a simple HTML and CSS Log in page that will be used by volunteers leaders of a National Environmental project called "Folhas que Salvam" where they can be identified, then allowed to a different web aplication.

## Some fields created for the User to fill up:

+ Email address
+ Password

## In addtion to the main part, I implement other features such as:

* The cursor changes when the user hovers on the big green "log in" buttom.
* I personalized the fonts with Browse Fonts.
* There is a slight movement coming from the planet and the leaves (animation) at the left, using storyset.

## These features are in development:

- The animation.

## Technologies Used:

  <tr>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>CSS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>  
    <td>5.0</td>
    <td>*</td>
  </tr>
