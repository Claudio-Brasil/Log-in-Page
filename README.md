### This is a simple HTML and CSS Log in page used by volunteers leaders of a National Environmental project called "Folhas que Salvam" where they can be identified, then allowed to a different web aplication.

## Some fields created for the User to fill up:

+ Email address

## In addtion to the main part, I implement other features such as:

* The cursor changes when the user hovers on the big green "log in" buttom.
* I personalized the fonts with Browse Fonts.
